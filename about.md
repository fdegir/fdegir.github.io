I am a technologist with a track record of over 15 years in infrastructure, CI/CD, DevOps, and platforms.
I have a big passion for developer productivity and experience and I contributed to may efforts both in corporate settings as well as in open source communities.

In the past, I worked as the Executive Director of [the Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) at [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
Before the Continuous Delivery Foundation, I worked as a Principal Developer at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) and I was involved in several large scale CI/CD initiatives within Ericsson and across open source.

I actively contribute to various open source projects as member of committees, team lead, and maintainer.
I served as a committer-at-large member in [OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org) Technical Steering Committee (TSC),
end user representative member in the CDF [Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](https://cd.foundation/about/toc/),
and as a member of [Nordix](https://www.nordix.org/) [Technical Committee (TC)](https://wiki.nordix.org/display/TC/Technical+Committee).

The initiatives I take part in aim to establish CI/CD principles and practices in the industry and across open
source while improving developer experience and productivity.
[OPNFV Cross Community CI (XCI)](https://opnfv-releng-xci.readthedocs.io) Project started within OPNFV
community during 2016 which I was the creator and technical lead of. XCI helped us to  pave the way for broader
collaboration across different open source communities in CI/CD and Infrastructure area. This resulted in an
initiative named [OpenCI](https://gitlab.com/openci) in April 2018. I am co-founder of this initiative which is
now dormant.

Following the work we have been doing within the industry and across various open source communities, we
[proposed](https://lists.cd.foundation/g/cdf-toc/topic/60607236) the formation of Special Interest Group (SIG)
Interoperability to [Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)](https://cd.foundation/). The SIG was
[approved](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/01/21/cd-foundation-technical-oversight-committee-approves-interoperability-sig/)
during January 2020 by CDF TOC. I  served as the co-chair to the SIG until January 2022.

In January 2022, we [proposed](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/pull/140) a new SIG, SIG Software Supply Chain.
The [SIG Software Supply Chain](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-software-supply-chain) is approved by the CDF TOC during February 2022.

In addition to CI/CD engagements listed above, I contributed to [OpenStack Baremetal SIG](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/bare-metal-sig),
[Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/) and [Eiffel Community](https://eiffel-community.github.io/).

In following sections, you will find the list of talks I've given, webinars, panels and interviews I've taken
part of and articles and blog posts I contributed to.
