I am working as a Principal Developer at [Ericsson Software Technology](https://www.est.tech) in Stockholm, Sweden.
My interests include automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Infrastructure and currently involved in several large scale
CI/CD initiatives both internally and within open source.

I served as a committer-at-large member in [OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org) Technical Steering Committee between
2016-2018 and I am currently a member of [Nordix](https://www.nordix.org/) Technical Committee.

The initiatives I take part in aim to establish CI/CD principles and practices in the industry and across open
source. [OPNFV Cross Community CI (XCI)](https://opnfv-releng-xci.readthedocs.io) Project started within OPNFV
community during 2016 which I am the creator and technical lead of. XCI helped us to  pave the way for broader
collaboration across different open source communities in CI/CD and Infrastructure area. This resulted in the
creation of a new community named [OpenCI](https://openci.io/) in April 2018 which I am the co-founder of.

In following sections, you will find the list of talks I've given, webinars, panels and interviews I've taken
part of and articles and blog posts I contributed to.
