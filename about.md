I am working as a Principal Developer at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com), Sweden. My interests include infrastructure, automation, and CI/CD.
Apart from being involved in internal projects, I contribute to different open source projects in varying levels such
as [OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org) and [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org).

I experiment with many different tools and doing things either as part of my job or just for fun and keep notes while
doing that. As you can guess, the notes tend to become a problem when they increase in number even though I try to keep
them in an organized way in different ways. (Evernote, OneNote, Git, etc.)

Finally, I decided to start moving my notes to github and interested in trying out github pages due to the ease of setup and
more importantly the possibility of using markdown.

It obviously didn't stop there and I started adding list of other stuff such as conference talks, articles, and various
engagements.

The views expressed on this website are my own and do not reflect the view of my employer and/or the open source communities I am involved in.
