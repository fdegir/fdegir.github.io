I am working as a Principal Developer at [Ericsson Software Technology](https://www.est.tech) in Stockholm, Sweden.
My interests include automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Infrastructure and currently involved in several large scale
CI/CD initiatives both internally and within open source.

I served as a committer-at-large member in [OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org) Technical Steering Committee (TSC) between
2016-2018 and I am currently a member of [Nordix](https://www.nordix.org/) Technical Committee. (TC)

The initiatives I take part in aim to establish CI/CD principles and practices in the industry and across open
source. [OPNFV Cross Community CI (XCI)](https://opnfv-releng-xci.readthedocs.io) Project started within OPNFV
community during 2016 which I was the creator and technical lead of. XCI helped us to  pave the way for broader
collaboration across different open source communities in CI/CD and Infrastructure area. This resulted in an
initiative named [OpenCI](https://openci.io/) in April 2018. I am co-founder of this initiative.

Following the work we have been doing within the industry and across various open source communities, we
[proposed](https://lists.cd.foundation/g/cdf-toc/topic/60607236) the formation of Special Interest Group (SIG)
Interoperability to [Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)](https://cd.foundation/). The SIG was
[approved](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/01/21/cd-foundation-technical-oversight-committee-approves-interoperability-sig/)
during January 2020 by CDF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). I currently serve as the chair to the SIG.
In addition to my involvement in [SIG Interoperability](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-Interoperability),
I am a contributor to CDF TOC.

In following sections, you will find the list of talks I've given, webinars, panels and interviews I've taken
part of and articles and blog posts I contributed to.
